# Quack-Type
Web extension that adds the support of several friends for every key you press

### Currently, only works for Firefox - This project was made for fun, and I make no promises to update

## Commands

#### To Activate Quack-Type
To active quacks on your current tab simply press Ctrl+q from this point on quacks will play on key presses related to your settings

#### To Deactivate Quack-Type
To deactivate quacks on your current tab simply press Alt+q, this will remove the event listener for quacks

Please note currently quacks will not be re-added by pressing Ctrl+q without first refreshing the page

##### For both commands they will only apply to the tab you were on when you triggered them, you must redo the command for each tab

## Automatic Quacking
The extension popup will allow you to grant host permissions to the extension, if done Quack-Type will be activated
automatically on every new tab, this permission can be revoked by hitting the same button any time.

## Settings

On install volume is set to 50% and all options are ticked

- Letters: Refers to any letter of the alphabet, capitalised and non capitalised
- Numbers: The top row of numbers on the keyboard
- Punctuation: Any other key such as actual punctuation or keys like Ctrl or Alt


## Note
Sometimes the mp3 file will not be recognised, this will result in the sound not playing and an error message in the
console but the extension will continue working.
